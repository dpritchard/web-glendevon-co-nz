# Introduction {#sec:introduction}

## In the course of research and intellectual activity, Researchers may create Intellectual Property and may collate, compile or transform Pre-existing Knowledge to support research activities. Through this policy Glendevon Research seeks to:

a) Reaffirm the rights of Content Creators with respect to Intellectual Property and Pre-existing Knowledge;

b) Support the development and dissemination of Intellectual Property; and

c) Highlight its commitment to ethical and responsible management of Intellectual Property and Pre-existing Knowledge to maximise benefits to the wider New Zealand community.

## In providing a framework for protection of Intellectual Property Rights and Pre-existing Knowledge, Glendevon Research acknowledges that a "one size fits all" approach may not be applicable in all circumstances. In particular Glendevon Research acknowledges that issues surrounding traditional Intellectual Property of Maori may not be adequately covered by this policy.

## These issues will be subject to ongoing policy development and the establishment of appropriate agreements with relevant parties. However, Glendevon Research reaffirms its commitment to the principles of the Treaty of Waitangi and will act according to the outcomes of any Treaty claims relating to indigenous Intellectual Property Rights.

## Glendevon Research acknowledges that commercialisation of Intellectual Property is not its core function. However, in some cases the further development and dissemination of Intellectual Property and maximisation of benefit to New Zealand may be best achieved through the commercial development of products, processes or ideas. Glendevon Research reserves the right to undertake commercial development of Intellectual Property and this policy provides a framework for undertaking Intellectual Property commercialisation whilst affirming the rights of Content Creators.

# Status of Policy

## **Binding on Researchers**: This policy, as amended from time to time, shall be binding on all Researchers engaged in research activities for, or on behalf of, Glendevon Research.

## **Individual agreements to prevail**: Glendevon Research reserves the right to enter into express agreements with Researchers relating to matters governed by this policy. Such agreements may be at variance with this policy, and in the event of any conflict between such agreements and this policy, the terms of the agreement shall prevail.

## Amendments

a) Glendevon Research may from time to time, and in its sole discretion, amend, restate, supplement or revoke this policy. Where practicable, Glendevon Research will discuss any such changes with Researchers prior to those changes taking effect.

b) This policy shall be amended as required to comply with all changes or additions to legal or regulatory obligations that may be relevant to Glendevon Research or its activities.

# Pre-existing Knowledge {#sec:pre-existing-knowledge}

## **Introduction**: Glendevon Research acknowledges that its research activities may involve the collation, storage, manipulation and use of Pre-existing Knowledge. Glendevon Research will use commercially reasonable endeavours to consult with, and seek the prior consent of, Content Creators before utilising Pre-existing Knowledge.

## **No claim to Third Party Pre-existing Knowledge**: Glendevon Research will not, and Researchers must not, assert any claim, right or entitlement to Pre-existing Knowledge of Third Parties. Nothing in this clause prevents Glendevon Research from asserting ownership or rights to:

a) Pre-existing Knowledge in respect of which a Content Creator has explicitly agreed to transfer or grant to Glendevon Research; or

b) Intellectual Property that was created using Pre-existing Knowledge with consent or approval of a Content Creator.

## **Disclosure**: Researchers must disclose, prior to the commencement of their engagement with Glendevon Research:

a) any Pre-existing Knowledge that has relevance to the Researcher's work for Glendevon Research that was developed by the Researcher before their engagement commenced;

b) whether that Pre-existing Knowledge is subject to any Third Party rights (for example the rights of the Researcher's previous employer, a publisher or a consultancy company); and

c) the terms of any agreement or arrangement (including but not limited to research and funding agreements preceding their engagement by Glendevon Research) which may restrict the work, or the development or use of Intellectual Property arising out of such work, of that Researcher with Glendevon Research.

# Intellectual Property {#sec:intellectual-property}

## **Ownership**: Where a Researcher creates any form of Intellectual Property:

a) in the course of their engagement by Glendevon Research; or

b) using Glendevon Research resources,

such Intellectual Property shall be the sole and unencumbered property of Glendevon Research, and the Researcher shall not be entitled to claim any Right to Intellectual Property, unless:

c) Glendevon Research agrees (in its sole and absolute discretion) in writing to relinquish its Right to that Intellectual Property; or

d) the terms of a written agreement between Glendevon Research and that Researcher provide otherwise.

## **No claim to Third Party Intellectual Property**: Glendevon Research will not, and Researchers must not, assert any claim, right or entitlement to Intellectual Property of Third Parties. Nothing in this clause prevents Glendevon Research from asserting ownership or rights to Intellectual Property in respect of which a Content Creator has explicitly agreed to transfer or grant to Glendevon Research.

## **Moral Rights**: Glendevon Research will respect and protect the moral rights which the law confers on Researchers.

## **Externally-funded research**: Ownership of Intellectual Property associated with an externally-funded research contract may be determined by the terms of the relevant contract. In the absence of any such provision the ownership of Intellectual Property associated with an externally-funded research contract will be determined in accordance with the provisions of this policy.

# Identification of Intellectual Property

## **Record keeping**: Researchers must at all times {#sec:ip-record-keeping}

a) during the course of their engagement by Glendevon Research; or

b) whilst using Glendevon Research resources,

maintain accurate, legible and complete Research Records and make copies of the same available to Glendevon Research. Glendevon Research may from time to time specify the form and content of Research Records which must be kept by Researchers under this clause [@sec:ip-record-keeping].

## **Identify and Report**: Researchers must identify, and promptly provide written reports to Glendevon Research of, all Intellectual Property generated during the course of their engagement by Glendevon Research or whilst using Glendevon Research resources. Reports submitted pursuant this clause [@sec:ip-identify-and-report] must, unless otherwise agreed by Glendevon Research, identify any Pre-existing Knowledge used in the generation of the Intellectual Property which is the subject of the report. {#sec:ip-identify-and-report}

## **Potential for Commercialisation**: When a Researcher has identified that Intellectual Property generated during the course of their engagement by Glendevon Research or whilst using Glendevon Research resources may have potential for commercialisation, he or she must report that potential in writing to Glendevon Research.

## **Review process**: Glendevon Research shall periodically review the Research Records of its Researchers and reports submitted by its Researchers to identify protectable and potentially valuable Intellectual Property Rights and associated commercial activities, and to prevent the infringement of Pre-existing Knowledge and associated commercial activities.

# Management of Intellectual Property {#sec:management-of-intellectual-property}

## **General policy statement**: Where Intellectual Property Rights are claimed by Glendevon Research or where Glendevon Research has been charged, either explicitly or implicitly, with the management of Intellectual Property or Pre-existing Knowledge, Glendevon Research will, and its Researchers must, use best endeavours to:

a) Manage that Intellectual Property and Pre-existing Knowledge ethically and responsibly.

b) Where it does not contravene the terms of external contracts, manage Intellectual Property or Pre-existing Knowledge to maximise the benefit to New Zealand.

c) Ensure all relevant parties are aware of the value of Intellectual Property and Pre-existing Knowledge.

d) Respect and acknowledge the contribution, ownership and rights of all relevant parties, including Content Creators.

e) Ensure appropriate attribution is given to all relevant parties, unless a preference for anonymity is expressed or implied.

## **Software Development**: Where Intellectual Property Rights involve the development of computer software (including code) and where it does not contravene the terms of external contracts or agreements with individual Researchers, preference will be given to:

a) The use of version control or source control software (e.g. Git, [http://git-scm.com](http://git-scm.com)) for the management, review, merging, branching and distribution of this software; and
b) The licencing of software under a compatible Free and Open Source Software (FOSS) licence ([http://freeopensourcesoftware.org](http://freeopensourcesoftware.org))

# Dissemination of Intellectual Property {#sec:dissemination-of-intellectual-property}

## **General policy statement**: Subject to confidentiality restrictions, and the rights of Third Parties, Glendevon Research supports the dissemination of Research Outcomes through the exchange, publication and presentation of those Research Outcomes. However, Researchers must not disseminate Research Outcomes without the prior written consent of Glendevon Research. The procedure for applying for consent is set out in clause [@sec:dissemination-of-intellectual-property-process].

## **Process**: {#sec:dissemination-of-intellectual-property-process}

a) A Researcher must notify Glendevon Research in writing if they wish to disseminate Research Outcomes, such notification detailing the content, form and audience of the proposed dissemination.

b) A Researcher who has notified Glendevon Research pursuant to sub-clause (a) must provide Glendevon Research with such further information regarding the proposed dissemination as Glendevon Research reasonably requires.

c) Glendevon Research shall, within 30 days of notification by a Researcher pursuant to sub-clause (a), advise the Researcher whether or not Glendevon Research consents to the proposed dissemination. Without limiting the grounds on which Glendevon Research may withhold its consent to a proposed dissemination, Glendevon Research may refuse to consent to a proposed dissemination if Glendevon Research determines (in its sole and absolute discretion) that the dissemination:

	i) may diminish the value of, or opportunity to exploit, the contained Intellectual Property;

	ii) may breach the terms of any agreement or other arrangement between Glendevon Research and any other person; or

	iii) is not in the best interests of Glendevon Research.

# Commercialisation of Intellectual Property

## **Right to commercialise**: Glendevon Research reserves the right to undertake commercial development of Intellectual Property to which it claims ownership or rights, provided it does not contravene:

a) The ethos of this policy outlined in Section [@sec:introduction] (*Introduction*); or
b) The provisions of Sections [@sec:pre-existing-knowledge] (*Pre-existing Knowledge*) or [@sec:intellectual-property] (*Intellectual Property*) above.

## **Consultation**: Wherever practicable, Glendevon Research will consult in good faith with parties affected by any decision to commercialise Intellectual Property, including Content Creators.

## **New Zealand preference**: Unless circumstances otherwise demand, Glendevon Research will use commercially reasonable efforts to ensure that commercialisation of Intellectual Property by Glendevon Research is undertaken within New Zealand.

# Conflicts of Interest

## **Disclosure**: Researchers must promptly disclose to Glendevon Research all potential conflicts of interest concerning the generation, ownership, management of Intellectual Property or Pre-existing Knowledge. Where a Researcher is unsure whether or not a potential conflict exists, the Researcher must disclose the matter to Glendevon Research. Without limiting the generality of this clause [@sec:conflicts-of-interest-disclosure], Researcher's financial interests in external firms that contract with Glendevon Research, particularly where such contracts involve research and/or the exchange of Intellectual Property Rights, must be disclosed. {#sec:conflicts-of-interest-disclosure}

## **Resolution in good faith**: Glendevon Research will consult in good faith with any Researcher with any actual or perceived conflict of interest, with the view to resolving or mitigating the risk of such a conflict.

# Confidentiality

## **General policy statement**: In the course of their research activities, Researchers may have access to, or be required to deal with, information which is subject to confidentiality arrangements between Glendevon Research and Third Parties. Glendevon Research will make such arrangements known to Researchers, and Researchers must abide by the terms of those arrangements.

# Experimentation on Humans & Animals

## **Personally identifiable information**: In the course research activities, Glendevon Research and its Researchers may collect and store personally identifiable information from research participants. To the extent that this is not already covered by: {#sec:personally-identifiable-information}

a) Clause [@sec:pre-existing-knowledge] (*Pre-existing Knowledge*);
b) Clause [@sec:management-of-intellectual-property] (*Management of Intellectual Property*); or
c) Clause [@sec:dissemination-of-intellectual-property] (*Confidentiality*), above

Glendevon Research will not, and its Researchers must not:
